The CASE statement is SQL’s way of handling if/then logic.

###

       year,
       CASE WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'yes'
            ELSE NULL END AS is_a_senior
  FROM benn.college_football_players
  
  
  ###
  SELECT player_name,
       weight,
       CASE WHEN weight > 250 THEN 'over 250'
            WHEN weight > 200 THEN '201-250'
            WHEN weight > 175 THEN '176-200'
            ELSE '175 or under' END AS weight_group
  FROM benn.college_football_players
